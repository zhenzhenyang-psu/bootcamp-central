## How good are these "best practices"

Look at [Best Practices][best] as published
in [Best Practices for Scientific Computing" , PLOS Biology, Jan. 2014][bestpub].

Frankly there just seem to be too many of them...
Imagine that you need to simplify this list:

1. Suppose that must reduce to just three.
   Which one will these be and why?\
   Basically: *What are the
   most important best practices?*
1. Suppose that want to remove three.
   Which one will these be an why?\
   Basically: *What are the least useful best practices?*

Add your own and see the results at [Best Practices: Keep or Toss][keep]
